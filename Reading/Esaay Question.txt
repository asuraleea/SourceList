Essay Question:
In Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes, some people believe Don Quixote is crazy because he imagines himself as a brave knight and sees the world differently from others. However, others think he is just a dreamer who wants to make the world a better place.
Write a three-paragraph essay explaining whether you think Don Quixote is truly insane or if he simply sees the world in a more imaginative way.
*   In your first paragraph, introduce who Don Quixote is and describe how he sees the world.
*   In your second paragraph, explain how his actions show either his madness or his strong beliefs. Use examples from the story.
*   In your final paragraph, share your own opinion-do you think Don Quixote is crazy, or is he a hero with a unique way of thinking? Explain why.
